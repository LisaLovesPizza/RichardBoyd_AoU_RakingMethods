Here's how to get started with the raking examples:

1. Download and process the US Census (PUMS) data.

       Run the notebook PUMS-Preprocessing.ipynb

       Move the output file (pums_usa_2019.csv) into the data/ folder.

2. Recode the PUMS data for use with the raking code.

       Run the notebook PUMS-Recoding.ipynb

3. Generate a synthetic input file for use with the census data:

       Run the notebook Synthetic-NHIS.ipynb

4. Run the US Census weighting example:

       Run the notebook Raking-PUMS.ipynb

5. Run the hospital weighting example:

       Run the notebook Raking-Hospitals.ipynb
